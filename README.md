#MyVIMRC

This is my vimrc. There are many like it, but this one is mine.

My vimrc is my best friend. It is my life. I must master it as I must master my life.

Without me, my vimrc is useless. Without my vimrc, I am useless. 

I must write my vimrc true. I must refactor straighter than my enemy who is trying to kill me. I must grok him before he shoots me. 

I will before God, I swear this creed. My vimrc and I are the defenders of my sourcecode. 

We are the masters of our codebase. We are the saviors of my life.

So be it, until there are no bugs, but peace. Amen.
